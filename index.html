    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed thousands of lives and disrupted millions of jobs, but neither burden has been shouldered equally across 
      American society. Since April 23, 2020, the Household Pulse Survey has collected weekly data from US adults regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic within households across 
      the country bifurcated into different geographies and ethic groups.
    </p >
    <p>
      The purpose of this study was to track trends in mental health symptoms, use of services, and unmet need for services among US adults, and to delineate variation across demographic strata.
     Data were drawn from the <b>2020 US Household Pulse Survey</b> from repeated cross-sectional online surveys collected between 
     <b>April 23 and November 23, 2020 from 1,302,455 US adults</b>, weighted to represent the US population. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, it became clear that its effects were not evenly 
      distributed. In particular, the pandemic had taken a higher toll on communities of color, as hospitalization and death rates had been significantly higher for those groups. Black and brown communities 
      in the US had been hit hardest, as is often the case in crises, worsening existing health and economic inequities
    </p >

    <h2>What do the visualizations indicate? </h2>
    <p>
      The charts below show weekly averages of the data for all respondents and by race and ethnicity from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, along with data for the 15 largest metropolitan statistical areas.
      The “week” we use in the graphics from week 13-47 are counted from April 23, 2020.
    </p >

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      The reported data are working with the following race/ethnicity group: Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latino (may be of any race), Two or more races + other race, White alone.
      The data is mapped by taking the time intervals on the x-axis and the mean indicators of each metric measured on the y-axis drilled down to the geography, and racial or ethnic group. 
      Each of the four metrics analyzed by us Depression & Anxiety, Unmet Mental Health Needs, Food Insufficiency and Saving Spending are mapped via their means on individual geographies state wise. 
      We acknowledge that the survey data uses weekly rolling averages to obtain more precise estimates at each point in time, owing to the considerable standard errors in some cases for the estimates when disaggregated by state/metropolitan statistical area and race or ethnicity.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      We looked at 4 broad metrics to understand the Impact of COVID-19 on American Households: <i> <b>
        Spending the Savings, Food Insufficiency, Depression and Anxiety,</b> </i> and  <i> <b> Unmet Mental Health Needs.
      </i></b>

        <!-- Spending Impact -->
        <h2><b>Spending the Savings</b></h2>
        <p>
          Occupational segregation, employment discrimination, and exploitation make economic downturns, such as the one created by the COVID-19 pandemic, worse in communities of color by destabilizing jobs, undermining small businesses, and increasing income shocks and unexpected expenses. These factors put people of color at greater risk of unemployment and limit their ability to weather economic downturns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The COVID-19 problem had caused unprecedented employment losses and pay and hour decreases. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Families First Act provided many families with financial assistance, such as enhanced unemployment insurance and stimulus payments, to endure the crisis. In many cases, these benefits were greater than what families earned by working; however, many families still relied on savings and credit cards to cover their expenses. Numerous families of color had less money and greater debt, therefore utilizing these resources may have a disproportion. 
        </p>
        <p>
          White families had higher liquid balances than Latinx or Black families. For  every dollar held by White families, Black families had just 44 cents and Latinx families 58 cents. Balance trajectories  of savings during the pandemic show similar patterns exhibited by each race group: median balances began rising in the first week, peaked in third following the disbursement of the first stimulus payment, and then fell slowly throughout the remainder of the year, before peaking again with the second and third stimulus payments.
        </p>

          The economic crisis caused by the pandemic has been devastating for people and communities of
          color. Black and Latino workers were much more likely to be unemployed than Whites when the
          shutdown happened. As of September, the unemployment rate was significantly lower for White
          workers than for workers of color. It was nearly half the unemployment rate of African Americans.
          According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, less Black and Latino people work in jobs that
          can be done remotely. They make up a disproportionate number of minimum wage,
          frontline, or essential jobs. These factors contribute to the high infection and unemployment
          rates these communties are seeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When shutdowns happened in April of 2020, unemployment rates in Bronx County and Naussau County
          jumped to about 16%. However, from May through September, the unemployment rate of Bronx County
          was double that of Nassau County, peaking at close to 25% unemployment in June. The latest
          unemployment figures from September of 2020 show that Bronx County has a high unemployment rate
          of about 19%, while most counties in the rest of state have single digit unemployment rates.
        </p>

            
    <h3>Key findings</h3>
    
    <p>
      People of color are more likely than white Americans to be unemployed or to work at multiple jobs instead of just one. The Hispanic/Latino community had the highest savings per week, highest at 32% with the Asian community leading at a close second. Even though people of color save more of their income each month, white Americans have a much greater median net worth. Black communities had the least saving spending due to inefficient budgeting and lower median incomes.

    <!-- Rates of Food Sufficiency Chart -->
    <h2><b>
      Food Insufficiency
     </b>
    </h2>

    <p>
      Families require access to food and income to purchase food in order to have a healthy and sufficient diet. However, COVID-19 had limited access to grocery stores, caused millions to lose income, and increased family food poverty, especially among Black and Latino households. Families of color already have higher rates of food insufficiency as a result of less financial stability and less access to nutritious food, both of which are exacerbated by structural racism.

    <h3>Key findings</h3>
    <p>
      People of Hispanic or Latino origin, Black people, and Other people have greater rates of food insecurity than the national average. Asians and Whites have lower rates of inadequacy than the national norm.
Asians had the lowest rates of food insecurity in most weeks, however the rate appears to fluctuate and is not very stable. The insufficiency rates of their ethic groups are more stable.
The disparity in food insecurity remains generally consistent across the country. Louisiana has the greatest rate of food insecurity (0.17), while Washington has the lowest rate (0.1). Food scarcity affects the central states more than the east and west states.
The distribution of food scarcity is analogous to the distribution of depression  and anxiety rates. The fear of quarantine and the subsequent food shortage issue could explain the sadness during the epidemic.

        Depression & Anxiety

      </h2>
       <p>
        Considering all of the factors that lower people’s quality of life, including but not limited food insufficiency, savings and spendings, and unmet mental health needs that we’ve discussed above or are going to discuss, the depression and anxiety rate continue to be at a high level in the post-covid eras. Disregarding the side effects triggered by those economic factors, those who experience a long period of COVID symptoms seem to have more mental issues due to discomfort fighting with the virus, such as fatigue and olfactory disorders (loss of smells).

If the total score was 3 or higher, then the respondent was identified as experiencing symptoms of depression. This definition follows the National Center for Health Statistics definition.

       <div style="margin:3em;"></div>

       <h3>Key findings</h3>
    

<p>
  There is a general increasing trend for the depression level during the earliest period of COVID (Week 13 - week 20), following by the decreasing trend after that (Week 20 - Week 47). Even though the general trending is similar across the races, there’re still gaps of the levels of depression level between different ethnicity groups. The discrepancy is clearer by inspecting the “ranks”, which shows that black and Hispanic groups usually are more depressed and anxious than the others on average, while white and Asians experience less of this. This result also matches and can be explained by the one from the “unmet mental health” part, where Hispanic and Black have more mental health need that are not satisfied. 
</p>
   
<p>
        
  Another discrepancy spotted is the difference in depression level geographically among the states. People from Louisiana indicate the most serious problem on anxiety and depression, while people from North Dakota experience the least. This might be partially due to the distribution of different ethnicity groups among the states, but more research needs to be done in order to have an exact conclusion.

        Unmet Mental Health Need
      </b>
    </h2>
    <p>The dread of contracting COVID-19; anxieties about material hardship, job security, and financial stability; 
      and the toll of social isolation and limited social connections increase the likelihood that individuals may experience depression or anxiety more frequently. 
      Studies have found that disparities in estimates of mental health disorders and mental health treatment indicate a striking disequilibrium between the potential need for and the use of mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.     </p>

    <h3>Key findings</h3>
    
    <p>
      People from two or more ethical groups, hispanic or latino group, and black group reported to have more unmet mental health needs than that of the national average.
        White people in general have a very similar trend as the national average.
        Asians in general have less unmet mental health needs, and this could also be related to the fact that they’ve also reported to have less depression and anxiety to begin with.
        State means do not vary as much across the country. The state with highest mean of unmet mental health need is Oregon (mean = 0.15), whereas the state with the lowest mean is North Dakota (mean = 0.08).

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div style="margin:1em;"></div>
    <p>
      The study utilized near-real-time data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey which tracks the weekly average
       by race/ethnicity and for each state and metro area of the percentage of respondents reporting employment income loss, 
       food insecurity, depression or anxiety, loss of health insurance, public health insurance coverage, and difficulty making their 
       rent or mortgage payment. 
    </p >
    <p>
       According to the analysis, African-American, Latinx, and mixed-race respondents had significantly higher rates than 
       the national average and than Asian or white respondents in the areas of food insufficiency, depression/anxiety, and difficulty paying rent, while Asian-American, 
       Black, and Latinx respondents had more difficulty than white respondents making their mortgage payment due to their low initial savings. As the virus continued to spread, 
       the share of Asian-American households where at least one person has lost employment income had risen above the national average, even as other groups began to see their rates fall,
        while among Latinx respondents rates of food insufficiency, uninsurance, and difficulty paying rent continued to rise.
    </p >
    <p>
      Moving forward, policymakers and practitioners can work toward an equal recovery for all Americans by pursuing solutions that account for the pandemic’s unequal effects on communities of color. 
      To design these race-conscious policies, policymakers need data to gauge how the pandemic may be affecting people’s health, housing, and livelihoods. We aim to understand these disparities using 
      data visualization for efficient policy making.
