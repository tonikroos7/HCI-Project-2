    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis like no other.
      As of November 15th, the United States has surpassed more than 11
      million confirmed cases and has already had over 200,000 deaths.
      Infection rates of this respiratory disease are climbing all over
      the United States. Americans are having to make changes to their daily
      lives to reduce the spread of this disease as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only is it a public health crisis, but COVID-19 has also unleashed
      an economic crisis in the United States. Businesses are closing, millions
      have lost their jobs, and millions are behind on rent or at risk of being evicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the impact COVID-19 has is not being felt equally across the nation.
      There are huge disparities in infection rates, death rates, and the economic
      and psychological fallout across racial and economic divides.

    </caption>
    <div style="margin:1em;"></div>
    <p>
      Clearly, the deaths are not proportional across different racial groups. There is a disparity in
      the death rates from COVID-19 between different racial groups. African and Indigenous Americans
      are suffering the greatest loss of life, both having COVID-19 death rates <b>greater than 1 in 1000</b>.
      Whites and Asians have the lowest death rates, both less than about half the current death rate
      among African Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stems from division that already existed in America long before the pandemic,
      and the pandemic has made those divisions even more obvious.

      Prior to the pandemic, wealth levels varied wildly across the country.
      In the map above, you can see that in each state, there are a pair of counties that
      are similar, but have a large economic disparity. The counties with
      less economic resources are also typically made up of more minority racial groups
      than the ones with more economic resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, in New York State, despite being similar in population size and geographic location,
      Bronx County and Nassau County have a large economic disparity. About 30% of households are
      below the poverty line in Bronx County, compared to just 6% in Nassau county. Bronx County is
      a majority-minority county, being made up of mostly Latinos and African Americans, whereas
      Nassau County is over 68% white.

    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating across the nation. However, some communities suffered at a greater rate
      than the others. For each state, we compared the incident rate, fatality rate, and insurance data for the aforementioned
      two counties with the greatest economic disparities. This allows us to show highlight the the varying degrees in which
      COVID-19 infection affected death rates alongside their respective racial makeup of the counties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continued from the previous example in New York State, despite the similarity in the incident rate (infection
      cases per 100,000 people) between Bronx County and Nassau County, the fatality rate at Bronx County is more than double the rate
      of Nassau County. This can be attributed to the economic disparity that is also reflected on the percentage
      of population with and without insurance in the two counties.

    <p>
      The economic crisis caused by the pandemic has been devastating for people and communities of
      color. Black and Latino workers were much more likely to be unemployed than Whites when the
      shutdown happened. As of September, the unemployment rate was significantly lower for White
      workers than for workers of color. It was nearly half the unemployment rate of African Americans.
      According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, less Black and Latino people work in jobs that
      can be done remotely. They make up a disproportionate number of minimum wage,
      frontline, or essential jobs. These factors contribute to the high infection and unemployment
      rates these communties are seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When shutdowns happened in April of 2020, unemployment rates in Bronx County and Naussau County
      jumped to about 16%. However, from May through September, the unemployment rate of Bronx County
      was double that of Nassau County, peaking at close to 25% unemployment in June. The latest
      unemployment figures from September of 2020 show that Bronx County has a high unemployment rate
      of about 19%, while most counties in the rest of state have single digit unemployment rates.

	</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin:3em;"></div>
    <p>
      All these factors culminate in the fact that communities that are being hit harder by COVID are
      experiencing higher depression rates during the pandemic. Even though there seems to be a consistent
      increase of depression symptoms throughout different ethnicity groups (p < 0.32), there is a clear discrepancy
      in the increase of depression symptoms based on household income (p < 0.01). Nearly half of people with a household
      income of < 20k express depression symptoms while less than 20 percent of people with a household
      income of > 75k express depression symptoms. As discussed before, most low-income counties
      tend to be composed of people of color rather than white Americans. While it is clear that everyone has been
      mentally affected by COVID-19, it's important to acknowledge that these communites have been hit worst of all.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div style="margin:1em;"></div>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the long-standing racial inequalities in America that
      are a product of systemic racism. People of color make up a disproportionate amount of low-wage
      essential workers who've had to keep working, at risk of their health. They've faced high death
      rates and unemployment rates from the COVID-19 crisis.
    </p>

      Although there are ongoing research on how technology can help remote work and mental health,
      this might not be an inclusive solution. From comparing the economic disparities between two counties,
      it is clear that counties with higher level of poverty suffer the most from the lack of access to
      the internet. In the case of Texas, 91.3% of homes have access to the internet in Williamson County,
      a county that is mostly made up of White Americans and only has 5.9% of households below the poverty level.
      Contrast this to Starr County, a county that is 99% Latino and has 35.3% of households below the poverty level,
      where only about half of all households have internet access. While technologists should develop
      better tools to combat mental health and financial disparity through the means of virtual
      resources, fair access to the internet should also be prioritized to close the gap.
